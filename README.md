# Learning-and-Data-Analysis-Using-R
This repository is for learning R and analysing data using R. It is a repository for peer to peer learning.


In this repository Prashant and Jonathan are storing documents, scripts and other files related to projects completed in R. 
This work is meant to demonstrate their technical ability and their analytic aptitude in understanding a problem and its context, and using data to draw conclusions about that problem.

One project included is concerned with women's health, and particularly maternal mortality.
